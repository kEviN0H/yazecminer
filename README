Yet Another ZEC Miner, CPU miner for https://z.cash/

Reimplementation of xenoncat/Tromp algorithm, just to understand
it better by myself.   Performs around the same as Tromp's equi1.
It's single-threaded on purpose, and uses 200 MB of memory now.
The aim was the pure C miner with no dependencies, that works of either
little-endian or big-endian platform (ultrasparc speed is so pathetic).

You may find pool-emu.pl handy for debugging your miners.

Code used:
- BLAKE2b reference implementation from RFC 7693
- BLAKE2b optimized for SSE4.1/SSE2, taken from equihash by John Tromp
    https://github.com/tromp/equihash
- SHA-256 taken from cgminer by Con Kolivas
    https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/
- JSON parser by Serge A. Zaitsev
